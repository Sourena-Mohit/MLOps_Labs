## Resolving Git Conflicts

Resolving a Git conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from two branches and requires manual intervention. Conflicts typically happen during operations like merging, rebasing, or cherry-picking.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Resolve Conflicts

1. **Understand When Conflicts Happen**
   - Conflicts arise when:
     - Two branches modify the same line in a file differently.
     - One branch deletes a file while the other modifies it.
     - Git cannot determine which changes to keep.

2. **Identify the Conflict**
   - After running a command like `git merge`, youâ€™ll see a message indicating conflicts:
     ```
     CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file_name>
     Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
     ```
   - Run this command to see a summary of conflicting files:
     ```
     git status
     ```

3. **Open the Conflicting File**
   - In the conflicting file(s), Git will insert markers to show the differences:
     ```
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Your changes in the current branch
     =======
     Changes from the branch youâ€™re merging
     >>>>>>> <branch-name>
     ```
   - `HEAD`: Shows your current branchâ€™s changes.
   - After `=======`: Shows the incoming branchâ€™s changes.

4. **Resolve the Conflict**
   - You must manually decide how to combine or choose changes.
   - **Options:**
     - **Keep Your Changes (Current Branch):**
       - Remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers, keeping the `HEAD` section.
     - **Keep Their Changes (Incoming Branch):**
       - Remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers, keeping the incoming branch section.
     - **Combine Both Changes:**
       - Edit the file to include changes from both branches in a meaningful way.
   - Example after resolving:
     ```
     Combined version of both changes.
     ```

5. **Mark the Conflict as Resolved**
   - After editing and saving the file(s), mark the conflict as resolved by adding the file(s) to the staging area:
     ```
     git add <file_name>
     ```

6. **Commit the Merge**
   - Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, complete the merge:
     ```
     git commit
     ```

7. **Continue (If Using Rebase or Cherry-Pick)**
   - For rebasing:
     ```
     git rebase --continue
     ```
   - For cherry-picking:
     ```
     git cherry-pick --continue
     ```

8. **Verify the Resolution**
   - Ensure the conflict is resolved correctly by reviewing changes:
     ```
     git log --graph --oneline
     ```
   - Run the project or test cases if necessary to confirm functionality.

9. **Tools to Simplify Conflict Resolution**
   - **Text Editors:** Use conflict resolution features in editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
   - **GUI Tools:** Use Git GUI tools like SourceTree, GitKraken, or Tower.
   - **Command-Line Merge Tool:**
     ```
     git mergetool
     ```
